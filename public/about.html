<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Rahul, and I am a passionate software developer with over six years of experience
  in creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer 
  Science from the University of California, Berkeley, where I graduated with honors. My journey in
  tech began when I was a teenager, tinkering with HTML and CSS to build my first website. This early
  interest blossomed into a full-fledged career, and I have since honed my skills in various 
  programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a Senior Full Stack Developer at a leading tech company in San Francisco, where I 
  lead a team of talented engineers. My role involves designing and implementing robust, scalable
  web solutions, as well as mentoring junior developers. One of my proudest accomplishments was
  developing an innovative e-commerce platform that significantly boosted our client's online sales. I
  thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling complex challenges that require creative
  problem-solving and strategic thinking.
</p>

<p>Outside of work, I am an avid traveler and amateur photographer. I love exploring new cultures and 
  capturing the beauty of the world through my lens. In my free time, you can find me hiking the trails 
  of Northern California, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or volunteering at local coding
  bootcamps to help aspiring developers kickstart their careers. I am always eager to connect with like
  minded professionals and explore new opportunities to grow and contribute to the tech community.
